## Reflection Groups Network

Reflection groups and Coxeter groups can be approached from algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial perspectives. 
They are deeply intertwined with a wide range of natural algebraic and geometric structures and play a central role across many areas of mathematics. 
Instances of reflection groups include:
- symmetry groups of regular polytopes,
- quotients of Artin–Tits (braid) groups,
- examples of non-positively curved (CAT(0)) groups,
- discrete reflection groups in geometric group theory, and
- arithmetic reflection groups defined over number fields.

Moreover,
- their root systems underpin the classification of semisimple Lie algebras and Lie groups,
- they occur as Weyl groups of semisimple and Kac--Moody algebras, as well as in the theory of cluster algebras, and
- they are central to the study of Hecke algebras, their generalizations, and the associated representation theory.

Understanding the properties of these groups, whether finite or infinite, is often key to understanding the structures built upon them. 
The variety of contexts in which they appear naturally invites a diversity of techniques and viewpoints. 

This network aims to bring together researchers from these strongly interconnected and vibrant areas, fostering exchange on recent developments and shared perspectives on common structures.
